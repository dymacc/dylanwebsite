        <h3>Call Me if you Get Hungry: Event Planning and Identity</h3>
        <p>2025</p>
        <p>Interactive Menu</p>
        <p>Call me if you get hungry was a culinary pop-up event that I organized in collaboration with chef Bella Romano. Bella and I are lifelong friends that have bonded over our love for Tyler the Creator's music for years. After seeing him in concert, we knew that we wanted to create an event to share with friends and colleagues that showcased our talents focused around a theme that we both love. Each dish was inspired by each album or era of his music. I knew that I needed to make materials that drove this story telling, but also created unity between the different aesthetics that we were exploring.</p>
        <p>The star of the show for me was the menu. Since it was a small seating of only 12 guests, I knew that I wanted to do something hands-on and experimental. I created an interactive menu that not only drove the storytelling, but became a part of the dining experience. Don't tap the glass and the broken glass motif was Tyler the Creator's most recent album project. The menu was created to mimick the broken glass and also serve as a template to be filled out as the dinner progressed. The underlayer has notes of each dishes, but no details about what album it pertains to or what is in it, the glass shards (that are also stickers) have the complete information about the dish. This reveal also mimicks the excitement of a new album release from your favorite music artist. There is just enough information to get you excited, then, the big reveal. This works well with the tasting menu format where the chef decides which courses will be served. The stickers can be applied as the dinner goes on and the full image of the concept is revealed. The completed product is a folder that holds the main menu, the shard stickers and also has plenty of space for imagery and storytelling aspects.</p>
        <p>The imagery was drawn by me in procreate and adobe photoshop. I used different visual motifs that are unique to Tyler the Creator. I printed each drawing and hand collaged each menu. The layers create a tactile effect that makes the menu fun to look at and touch.</p>
        <p>To the right is an image of the menu closed cover with a peak of the menu inside. The images below show the menu before and after use. The pocket on the left holds the stickers and the menu on the right is lightly held by glue tack and can be removed if desired.</p>

        <h3>Call Me if you Get Hungry: Beyond the menu</h3>
        <p>2025</p>
        <p>Flyer, Playlist, Social Media Posts</p>
        <p>To the right is the flyer that we used to get the word out about the dinner. Like the menu it is digitally illustrated to push the storytelling of the dinner and the aesthetics of Tyler the Creator. The square format made it effective to share on social media and digitally, it also is like a record or a CD.</p>
        <p>This image was also used as the cover for the playlist that we made to go along with the experience. Since it was music-centric, it made sense for us to make a playlist for our guests to explore ahead of time to get them excited and familar with the theme.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I created a labeling/tagging system for the social media post roll out that took place after the dinner. Our photographer (Jayie Chou) staged images of each dish. Since the colors and themes of the dish are so intertwined with different Tyler the Creator albums, we wanted a visual system that could show off the dish and also give information about it and it's inspiration. Inspired by Tyler the Creator's call me if you get lost album, I edited the calling card that he used on that album cover and identity to showcase information about the dish and it's themes.</p>
        <p>Below are some of the social media posts included.</p>
