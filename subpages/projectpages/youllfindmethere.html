        <h3>You'll Find Me There: The relationship between isolation and progress</h3>
        <p>(14x20) - 2024<br>This series explores desperately grasping onto stability and perceived power in times of social or emotional hiatus, even when you know it’s time to change. Removing the trigger removes the problem…right? When does “protecting your peace” turn into a subconscious attempt to scare others away? Intimidation can be so comforting for the intimidator when directed intentionally, but what about when it’s not? Although stepping away to look inward, heal, and grow is often seen as a positive thing to do there’s no way to quantify your progress until you emerge back out into the world again. After reforming one’s identity in recluse, rebirth not as simple as “stepping out of your comfort zone” (not to say that’s always simple), it requires parts to be rewritten, but not lost in translation or you’ll end up back at square one. It’s a delicate dance.</p>

        <h3>Writing and Typography</h3>
        <p>The poetry that I wrote about this topic was the driving force in creating this project. I'd been thinking a lot about the concept of coming off as "intimidating" to others even when I feel very sensitive. This opened up topics of isolation, harshness, loneliness, and sensitivity. What does it mean to improve these things about yourself? It seems like taking time alone to reflect is the best option, but how do you know when or how to re-emerge without making the situation worse? These posters and writing don't provide a solution, but more so capture a familar feeling. <br> For these posters I created hand drawn typography to be paired with the classic serif font caslon. The drawn typeface is meant to compliment the swirling vines of a willow tree. The shading gives it a dimensionality that let's it also emerge from the page like the subject is doing from the darkness in the image. I chose to pair it with caslon because I wanted a simple serif font that mimics the variation in line weight of the hand drawn type, but is easy to read and doesn't steal the show.</p>
        <h3>Collabortation</h3>
        <p>This project was done in collaboration with photographer Jayie Chou and lighting assistant Haven Overton. We set out to create images that tell a story of isolation and re-emerging from a time of self reflection. We do this through harsh and limited lighting that leaves large areas of darkness for the figure to emerge from. These large areas of darkness also create places for the typography to stand out from. <br> When modeling, I focused on staying low and having my body in an unnatural, and seemingly uncomfortable crouched position. This creates an erie feeling and shows that I am unsure and not confident about coming back into the world.</p>
