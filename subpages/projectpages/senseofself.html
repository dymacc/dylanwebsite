        <h3>Letterpress and Crochet project: Sense of Self</h3>
        <p>2025</p>
        <p>Quilt and Book</p>
        <p>In my letterpress classes I had an ongoing facination with the relationship between crochet and letterpress work. They felt related to me because in both practices small pieces come together to make a larger product. They also both have a meditative quaility. This was my last project during my undergraduate studies at SAIC and I knew that I wanted it to be something that celebrated the progress I've made but also emphasized the work I will continue to do. </p>
        <p>An important feature of my time at SAIC was how much progress I made when it came to getting to know myself. As a teenager and in my early years in undergrad I thought that I had everything figured out. As time went on and projects unfolded I continued to learn more about myself and make deposits into the larger bank of my personality. I didn't realize that this was going on until my last year when I was looking back at all I had done. I often felt anxious about what's to come or who I'm becoming, but this project serves to remind me that everything I do is just a small part of the giant whole that I am.</p>
        <p>This concept relates both to letterpress and crochet because of the small parts that come together to create a piece in those mediums. The product was a large quilt that I can wrap around myself, and three editions of a book with poetry and compositions using photo polymer plate stamps made from images of the crocheted squares.</p>

        <h3>Sense of Self: Process </h3>
        <p>2025</p>
        <p>The process to create the crocheted typeface had many steps. First I created pixel patterns for each of the letters and characters that I wanted to include. I used a method called filet crochet which utilizes positive and negative space to display an image. I created each square with a hook and yarn then scanned them to get a clear and flat image of the positive and negative space. I adjusted the levels so I had purely black and white then reduced their size to better match the page size I would be using. I made negatives of the squares and exposed photo polymer plates. Sections where the light gets through to the polymer harden and the protected areas wash away creating a surface that can create a relief print. I was able to move the squares around on the page using a high adjusted base then registered the words of the poem in places that seem to connect the blocks of crochet squares. Since I was using images to expose the polymer, the orignal squares were uneffected and could then be stictched together to create the quilt.</p>
