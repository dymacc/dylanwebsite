        <h3>Movie Genre Swap: Minions</h3>
		<p>2023</p>
		<p>20 x 30</p>
        <p> This project is a hand-painted, mixed-media reinterpretation of the original Minions movie poster. It is designed to transform a digitally rendered, character-centric promotional image into a textured, tactile artwork created through watercolor and collage techniques. The goal of the remake is not only to reproduce the recognizable charm of the Minions themselves, but also to reimagine the visual style of the poster through traditional art methods, emphasizing the warmth, personality, and handcrafted nature that watercolor uniquely provides.</p>
        <p>The process began with breaking down the original poster composition into layered components. Each character, prop, and background element was sketched individually onto watercolor paper and painted separately. This segmented approach allowed for greater control over color saturation, contrast, and detail, and enabled each piece to be manipulated independently during the collage phase. Watercolor was chosen for its dynamic range, which moves smoothly from soft gradients to punchy, saturated tones, and this quality offered a fresh interpretation of the Minions’ iconic yellow and denim color palette. Through the use of wet-on-wet washes, subtle texture variations were built into their bodies, giving the characters a more organic, tactile quality that is absent from the digital original.</p>
        <p>A key intentional choice in the remake was to maintain the playful spirit of the Minions while elevating the artistic aesthetic. The textured watercolor surfaces softened the characters’ bold outlines, giving them a more storybook-like appearance. The uneven edges of the scanned pieces, along with slight variations in pigment, further reinforced the handmade feel. These qualities contrast with the polished, CGI-based promotional imagery typically associated with the Despicable Me franchise, resulting in a piece that feels more intimate, expressive, and artistically driven.</p>
