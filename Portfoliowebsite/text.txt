Art Bash Project:

Art Bash is an end of the year celebration for the first year students at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
The theme is contemporary art and design, celebrating the new ideas that come from the schools contemporary practices program. 
The goal of the identity is to harness the experience of embarking on a new journey as a first year student highlighting their
discoveries, development, and the path that they will take moving forward. The posters will inform students and faculity of the different events and chances to submit work to be exhibited. The main event poster is large and shows all that Art Bash has to offer. The due date posters serve as an encouragement and a reminder to first year students to submit their work to the exhibition.

The Art Bash 2026 identity that I created captures the spirit of composing and subverting one’s artistic expression. The Contemporary Practices program embodies this by introducing students to new ways of creating and experiencing art. Students are uncertain of what will come of their journey, but each discovery sparks the next. This builds a momentum of exploration and growth.
The identity embraces error as discovery. Glitching generates unexpected forms, colors, and compositions through continual iteration and chance. Expectations and methods of making are subverted by bending tools beyond their intended use to construct new results. In revealing what lies beneath the surface, each glitch uncovers hidden structures and possibilities, allowing something entirely new to emerge from what was once unseen. These moments of disruption and restoration compose a symphony that reveals the evolving portrait of one’s creative self.
